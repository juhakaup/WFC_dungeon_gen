# Weekly report 1

Most of the time this week was spent on choosing the project. 

The dungeon generator seemed appealing. So I looked into multiple ways dungeon are generated, most of the algoritms seemed a bit simple for the scope of this class.

The wave function collapse -algorithm seems a bit more complicated, and like a useful algorithm to know. It's a bit hard to determine the scope, but the idea seems simple enough, but not too simple.

Other tasks this week included writing these documents and setting up the project.

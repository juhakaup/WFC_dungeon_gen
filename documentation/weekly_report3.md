# Weekly report 3

I got the basic propagation algoritm to work quite quickly. Then spend quite alot of time debugging it as it seemed to behave a bit strangely. This was propbably due to bad data. After re-writing the algoritm, fixing my data and going back to my original implementation, I'm pretty sure it works. 
Loading data fron JSON is also now implemented. Decided to write a simple gui for the program with javafx, at the moment it is just an output window, but I will implement some controls next week.

Next week I'll start implementing my own version of priority queue, fix and refactor the existing code, continue work on the ui and think about post processing and validating the generated dungeon.
